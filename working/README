001_mk_data.r produces a new text file called 001_covid_daily.csv.  This script does the following: 
  1. combines all raw .csv files located at the above location. 
  2. standardizes columns (The data format changed between the 3/21/2020 and 3/22/2020 files)
  3. standardizes contents of the columns (lowercase all values)
  4. builds variables to cover the entire time frame of the data. For example, combined_key only exists 3/22 onward, uses province / country from observations before 3/22/2020 to build this variable across all time periods)
  
The script does NOT attempt to standardize specific locations into standard labels.  For example, country/region can indicate "China" and "Mainland China."  These are NOT combined into a common label "China."
